Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Recursive Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems is a vital field that is
 commonly associated with robotics, object-tracking and the like as demonstrated
 for example by

.
 Sequential Monte Carlo methods (also referred to as the SIR

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 filter or the particle filter) is a broad Bayesian estimation subfield
 attractive mainly when the posed problem doesn't offer analytical Bayesian
 solution.
 Among other publications, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "HofSmiPech:09,HofSmi:09"

\end_inset

 have shown that SMC techniques can be successfully applied to tracking
 of the radioactive plume in the early phase

\end_inset

 of an atmospheric radioactive pollutant release accident.
 Should the research result in a self-contained and reliable tool, it would,
 in our opinion, significantly help personnel involved with the accident
 in making informed decisions, as SMC can effectively combine various noisy
 data sources into one coherent estimation of the situation.

which can be further extended to give future prediction
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This text aims to be a one step among many towards this goal.
 Specifically, we're concerned with computational efficiency of variations
 of the SMC technique in the first place, and secondly we've set up a goal
 of implementing basics of the desired tool.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This text is organized as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the first chapter the theoretical foundations of the Bayesian estimation
 are reviewed and algorithm of the particle filter is described and briefly
 discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Second chapter presents physical background of the pollutant release and
 model we've used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Chapter 3 combines previous chapters to form complete assimilation technique
 adapted to radioactive release.
 Proposal distribution possibilities are discussed and 2 are chosen to be
 benchmarked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally, results from the comparison are presented.
 Furthermore our approach implementing the assimilation software is described
 and Cython is used to dramatically speed up Python code.

 filter) and its variants within the framework of Bayesian statistics.
 The problem of the recursive Bayesian estimation is first stated, its general
 solution is then briefly derived.
 Finally, the particle filter is then introduced as an approximation of
 the general solution and its properties and alternate forms are discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Recursive Bayesian Estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose a hidden state vector sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1:t}$
\end_inset

 has to be estimated in discretized time steps 
\begin_inset Formula $1:t$
\end_inset

 using a sequence of measurements 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1:t}$
\end_inset

 with knowledge of the state model (which describes how state evolves in
 time) and the observation model (which describes how a given state 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 is observed in 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

).
 Suppose also that both state model and observation are encumbered by random
 noise, whose statistical parameters are known.
 Such situation can then be mathematically formalized as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
x_{t} & =f_{t}(x_{t-1},v_{t-1})\label{eq:DynSysFt}\\
y_{t} & =h_{t}(x_{t},w_{t}),\label{eq:DynSysHt}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the state model at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the random noise of the state model at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the observation model and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the observation noise at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Both state and observation models often don't depend on time and are referred
 to simply as 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 To make our reasoning bellow correct, one must further assume that both
 state and observation posses the Markov property, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 depends only on 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
General solution (in Bayesian sense) of the problem is known and portrayed
 here.
 Both 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}\;(\forall t)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{r}\;(\forall t)$
\end_inset

 are treated as (multivariate) random variables from now on.
 First, let us observe that the state probability density function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x_{t}|x_{t-1})$
\end_inset

 can be derived from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:DynSysFt"

\end_inset

 and the observation probability density function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(y_{t}|x_{t})$
\end_inset

 can be derived from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:DynSysHt"

\end_inset

 likewise.
 So-called 
\emph on
prior
\emph default
 probability density function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1})$
\end_inset

 can be expressed using only known densities by applying reverse marginalization
 over 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, applying chain rule for probability density functions and finally taking
 into account that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1}) & =\int p(x_{t},x_{t-1}|y_{1:t-1})\;\mathrm{d}x_{t-1}\nonumber \\
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1}) & =\int p(x_{t}|x_{t-1},y_{1:t-1})p(x_{t-1}|y_{1:t-1})\;\mathrm{d}x_{t-1}\nonumber \\
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1}) & =\int p(x_{t}|x_{t-1})p(x_{t-1}|y_{1:t-1})\;\mathrm{d}x_{t-1}.\label{eq:PriorPdf}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next straightforward step in the solution is to derive 
\emph on
posterior
\emph default
 probability density function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x_{t}|y_{1:t})$
\end_inset

, which is done by applying the Bayes' theorem and taking the fact that
 observation 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 depends only on the newest state 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(y_{t}|x_{t},y_{1:t-1})=p(y_{t}|x_{t})$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t}) & =\frac{p(y_{t}|x_{t},y_{1:t-1})p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1})}{p(y_{t}|y_{1:t-1})}\nonumber \\
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t}) & =\frac{p(y_{t}|x_{t})p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1})}{p(y_{t}|y_{1:t-1})},\label{eq:PosteriorPdf}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where the denominator of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:PosteriorPdf"

\end_inset

 can be computed using marginalization over 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 or not at all, because it doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 and serves only the purpose of the normalization constant.
 Formulas 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:PriorPdf"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 together form the solution of the problem posed above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, this solution in its general form has only limited applicatio
n, because the integral 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:PriorPdf"

\end_inset

, unless tractable analytically, constitutes a major computational challenge.
 The situation when the analytical solution is known is represented mainly
 by the famous Kalman filter
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kalman:60"

\end_inset

 and its variants, which applies when state and observation models are linear
 and noises are normally distributed.
 If these models are highly non-linear (which is our case in radioactive
 release assimilation), one of the viable approaches is to resort to some
 kind of approximation of the solution.
 One such approximation is the particle filter described below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Particle Filter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The particle filter (or sequential Monte Carlo technique, SIR filter) is
 based on approximation of the posterior probability density function using
 the weighted empirical density
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t})\approx\sum_{i=1}^{N}\omega_{t}^{(i)}\delta(x_{t}-x_{t}^{(i)}),\label{eq:PFPosterior}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the total number of particles (an important parameter of the filter),
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{t}^{(i)}$
\end_inset

 is the weight of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

-th particle

\begin_layout Plain Layout
constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{N}\omega_{t}^{(i)}=1\quad\forall t$
\end_inset

 must hold
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and finally 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}^{(i)}$
\end_inset

 is the value of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th particle, a hypothetical state the model could be in.

 When new observation 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$

The biggest advantage of the particle filter comes from the fact that only
 sampling from the proposal density and evaluation of it, the transition
 and observation density is needed, thus it can be applied to virtually
 any problem of recursive Bayesian estimation, regardless of analytical
 tractability of the integrals therein.
 However, this comes with a cost.
 First and foremost, the particle filter is an approximate and stochastic
 method.
 While convergence to the optimal Bayesian solution

 improves as

Another phenomena worth mentioning is the

 problem, which is described as a tendency of the weights of all-but-one
 particle to drop to zero as time progresses (unless counter-measured).
 Untreated, this can have a devastating effect on the accuracy of the filter
 as its posterior density degenerated to a single Dirac delta function.
 The major approach to eliminate this is the resampling described in step

 The resampling step mitigates some effects of the sample impoverishment,
 but if

 This is most pronounced when the proposal density doesn't match the resulting

 where very low

 Various techniques to combat this exist, virtually all of which use proposal
 density 
\begin_inset Formula $q(x_{t}|x_{t-1},y_{t})$
\end_inset

 (or its approximation) to optimize sampling phase of the particle filter.
 This is possible because there's a relative freedom in proposal density
 choice, as only strict requirement posed on it is that is is not narrower
 than the actual posterior density.

 Only puff trajectories are shown, total ground doses would be straightforward
 to compute and are not considered; each color represents trajectory of
 one puff, each line represents one particle in the particle filter, its
 opacity is proportional to its weight.
 Thicker bunches of one color at given time therefore signify higher uncertainty
 (variance) in trajectory estimation of that puff.
 Comparing assimilated trajectories with simulation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 both assimilation techniques succeeded in tracking the radioactive plume.
 Furthermore, trajectories obtained using the naive and conjugate proposal
 are visually indistinguishable.

\begin_layout Standard
One interesting effect can be seen on both figures: approximately the first
 70 minutes the variance of trajectories is extremely low and both particle
 filters assign negligible weights to all-but-one one particle.
 This coincides with the phase when the puffs can be observed using dose
 measurements from radioactive monitoring network receptors (denoted by
 blue dots in the figures).
 Our explanation is that this is due to dose measurement model being extremely
 non-linear, where a small (tens of meters) shift in puff trajectory causes
 dramatic change in assigned likelihood.
 In other words, the dose part of the observation model is extremely tight-peake
d compared to the transition model.
 To confirm this claim, we've run the assimilation again, but this time
 the dose measurements weren't supplied to the filters.
 Results of these filters are shown in

 Indeed, trajectory variance raised right from the beginning there and continued
 to be slightly greater through the rest of the experiment compared to dose-awar

 In the first phase (again lasting around 70 minutes, or 7 time steps) both

 they would gain weight and their

 Even the filter with conjugate proposal, that takes anemometer measurements
 into account when drawing particles, suffers from the sample impoverishment
 problem.
 We argue that this is because even the improved proposal density has much
 greater variance than the observation model (dose part of it).
 The second phase sees sharp rise of the effective particles, which is especiall

 While this is expected, we consider the second figure much more important;
 indeed, it answers the main question we've posed:

 For this the PyBayes library was extended with implementation of the gamma
 distribution, inverse gamma distribution and common conditional variants
 thereof.
 Additionally, the particle filter from PyBayes was taught to make use of
 the proposal distribution in form of another Bayesian filter.
 Motivation for this is 2-sided: 
\emph on
a)
\emph default
 the proposal density has the form 
\begin_inset Formula $q(x_{t}|x_{t-1},y_{t})$
\end_inset

, which coincides with the posterior density of a Bayesian filter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:PosteriorPdf"

\end_inset

; it has sense to plug the posterior density of for example a Kalman filter
 as a proposal density approximation into the particle filter, 
\emph on
b)
\emph default
 another option would be to pass a conditional probability density function
 directly, but that would involve (potentially expensive) double evaluation
 of its condition under current PyBayes constraints.

\begin_layout Subsection
Optimization Using Cython
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While programmer convenience, fast prototyping and availability of many
 supplemental 3rd party packages are appreciated when Python is used, it
 is well-known fact that Python itself is badly suited for expensive numerical
 computations.
 The Cython project allows one to compile Python code into C code which
 can subsequently be compiled into binary Python extension modules (technically
 dynamically-loaded libraries: .so files on UNIX and .dll files on Windows
 platforms) that behave very similarly to interpreted .py modules, but needn't
 be interpreted by the Python interpreter.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BehBraCitDalSelSmi:11"

\end_inset

 This provides moderate speedup of 0% to 300% because it eliminates the
 interpreter overhead.
 However, much more dramatic improvement can by achieved by statically typing
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Python itself is a dynamically-typed language: a variable can arise with

\end_layout

\end_inset

 variables that are part of the critical code paths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Static typing is usually achieved by extending the Python language, which
 breaks compatibility.
 However, Cython offers so-called pure Python mode, where the implementation
 is written in strict Python language and 
\emph on
augmented
\emph default
 using .pxd files that contain static typing declarations.
 This allows the programmer to prototype quickly using Python (perhaps testing
 on a reduced-size problem) and once happy with the algorithm, use Cython
 to achieve required performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Profiling our code we've identified that over 97% of the time was spent
 computing the 4D integration 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

.
 All involved variables were statically typed, and after compiling using
 Cython, we've noted execution time drop from 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[651]{s}$
\end_inset

 to mere 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[3.53]{s}$
\end_inset

, a 
\begin_inset Formula $\unit[184]{\times}$
\end_inset

 speedup.
 This is especially pronounced in the assimilation experiment, where the
 simulation is run 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 times with 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1000$
\end_inset

 in our case; this is the reason why assimilation wasn't even tested under
 the pure Python mode.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We've achieved moderate success showing favorable properties of the sequential
 Monte Carlo technique enhanced with conjugate proposal density.
 On the other hand, we were unable to attain improvement (with regards to
 number of effective particles) in the first phase of the experiment where
 the dose measurements dominate the observation model with our approximation
 of the optimal proposal density.
 In our opinion, this is mainly due to the fact that our variant cannot
 account for dose measurements.
 We propose following techniques to be studied to improve efficiency:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
incorporating dose observation into proposal density.
 This natural approach is not straightforward to achieve, as inverting dose
 observation model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:AsimYCPdf"

\end_inset

 is not analytically tractable in contrast to the wind field model.
 We propose extending the proposal density with gradient techniques for
 finding local maxima of the dose observation density.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
shortening the assimilation time step.
 In our view the 10-minute step is too rough and variance in wind direction
 causes poor results when simulated doses are compared against measured
 ones.
 This approach is unfortunately unachievable with current monitoring network
 infrastructure, and furthermore its gains questionable given that shorter
 time step could cause greater error in receptor read-outs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be further noted that assimilation problem described here is a
 rather simplified version of the problem faced in real life.
 We assume that released activities, atmospheric stability category and
 distribution of radionuclides in the release is known.
 This is not the case in most situations.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SmidlHofman:12"

\end_inset

 already adds released activity 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 to the list of assimilated quantities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another outcome of this text is the finding that the radioactive monitoring
 network provides the most valuable information for tracking the toxic plume.
 On the other hand, dose receptors are laid very scarcely in areas more
 distant from the nuclear site.
 If there were more sensors in the area, our uncertainty about the plume
 trajectory would be much lower.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we've implemented presented algorithms using clean object-oriented
 approach with future extensions in mind.
 Existing PyBayes library that was developed earlier was used for algorithms
 of Bayesian estimation, and Cython Python-to-C compiler was employed with
 great success to increase performance of the Python code to levels comparable
 with low-level languages.

\begin_layout Chapter*
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After starting with a brief review of some known results from the recursive
 Bayesian estimation with accent on the particle filter (sequential Monte
 Carlo method), we've presented hypothetical but realistic scenario of an
 atmospheric radioactive pollutant release.
 The puff model was chosen to simulate it for its relative simplicity and
 adequateness for particle filter estimation, and is briefly described.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the next chapter, assimilation model is inferred using the release scenario
 and described in more detail.
 Continues a discussion about techniques to fight the sample impoverishment
 problem, a phenomenon that degrades quality of the estimation especially
 noticeable in situations where the transition model (probability density
 function thereof) is significantly broader than the observation model ---
 the case we've faced.
 The problem is most usually solved using appropriate choice of the proposal
 density: the naive proposal was set to be benchmarked against a so-called
 conjugate proposal, whose form was subsequently derived for our choice
 of the wind field transition and observation model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then it was shown that both particle filter variants are able to successfully
 track the plume trajectory, however the emphasis was put on computational
 resources needed by the filter variants to achieve a certain level of accuracy
 expectation.
 For this purpose a measure of effective particles per second was suggested.
 The conjugate proposal technique was recorded to achieve roughly double
 the rate during the second phase of the assimilation, and declared well
 worth the complexity it adds.
 On the other hand, both variants suffered equally from the sample impoverishmen
t problem within approximately first 70 minutes of the simulated release;
 discussion that followed pointed to ignorance of the dose measurements
 in the chosen proposal as the main cause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, some implementation details are revealed and interface of the core
 classes employed in an object-oriented software design is shown; these
 form the basis of the Asim software project whose implementation was started.
 A notable speedup of the code written in Python was achieved by engaging
 the Cython Python-to-C compiler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we were to identify 2 main contributions of this work, it would be according
 to us:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Performed comparison of the naive and conjugate particle filter proposal
 densities with regards to resources needed to compute one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 performed under a realistic and demanding dispersion model assimilation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The implementation of the radioactive release assimilation and simulation
 framework itself (coupled with enhancements of the PyBayes library).
 We believe that it can be extended painlessly in future to cope with larger-sca
le problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speaking about future work, we suggest to extend the assimilation to more
 quantities to be more useful for actual emergency situations.
 This includes assimilation of released activities (already shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SmidlHofman:12"

\end_inset

) and distribution of the radionuclides within the release.
 Furthermore the model of weather-related variables as presented here was
 rather simplistic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the performance of the assimilation seems near-optimal on a uniprocessor
 machine thanks to Cython, parallelization is still being worked on and
 was not yet employed in results shown in this text.
