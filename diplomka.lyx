 presents a general mathematical apparatus that our solution is based on
 (the recursive Bayesian estimation) along with more specific method that
 can be viewed as an application of the framework.
 Their inclusion in this text serves two purposes: completeness and forming
 a basis for the software design presented later, which happily borrows
 concepts from the underlying mathematics.
 The chapter continues with description of models used to represent real-world

\begin_layout Standard
We are concerned with assimilation of radioactive pollutants as they disperse
 in the atmosphere; that is to give the best estimate of the pollutant distribut
ion in the environment and its progress in time, given a set of measurements
 with varying degree of accuracy.
 The problem is approached using the mathematical framework of recursive
 Bayesian estimation, which is briefly presented in the first section.
 This general problem statement and solution is then followed by description
 of a so-called Particle Filter,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
also known as the Sequential Importance resampling (SIR) or Sequential Monte
 Carlo method
\end_layout

\end_inset

 a variant of which is employed to perform the assimilation.
 The chapter continues with description of models representing actual phenomena:

Recursive Bayesian Estimation

\begin_layout Standard
Recursive Bayesian estimation
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 yields an estimate (in form of probability density functions) of a sequence
 of hidden state vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1:t}$
\end_inset

 at discrete time steps 
\begin_inset Formula $1:t$
\end_inset

 given sequence of available measurements (observations) 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1:t}$
\end_inset

, known (or assumed) noisy state model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:DynSysFt"

\end_inset

 and known (or assumed) noisy observation model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:DynSysHt"

\end_inset

.
 State model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:DynSysFt"

\end_inset

 describes how state evolves in time; more precisely it prescribes that
 state 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

, depends on previous state 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 and random state noise 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 (whose statistical properties need to be known) through the means of function
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{t}$
\end_inset

, which often does not vary with time and is therefore labeled just 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, measurement model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:DynSysHt"

\end_inset

 prescribes that visible measurements 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

, depend via function 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{t}$
\end_inset

 (often just time-independent 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

) on hidden state 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 and random observation noise 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}$
\end_inset

, probability density function of which is likewise known.
 Summarizing this, we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
x_{t} & =f_{t}(x_{t-1},v_{t-1})\label{eq:DynSysFt}\\
y_{t} & =h_{t}(x_{t},w_{t}).\label{eq:DynSysHt}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bayesian solution can now be derived.
 Both 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}\;(\forall t)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{r}\;(\forall t)$
\end_inset

 are treated as (multivariate) random variables from now on.
 First, let us observe that the 
\emph on
state probability density function
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x_{t}|x_{t-1})$
\end_inset

 can be derived from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:DynSysFt"

\end_inset

 and the 
\emph on
observation probability density function
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(y_{t}|x_{t})$
\end_inset

 can be derived from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:DynSysHt"

\end_inset

 likewise.
 So-called 
\emph on
prior
\emph default
 probability density function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1})$
\end_inset

 can be expressed using only known densities by applying reverse marginalization
 over 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, applying chain rule for probability density functions and finally taking
 into account that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 when already conditioned on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 we assume Markov property) 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1}) & =\int p(x_{t},x_{t-1}|y_{1:t-1})\;\mathrm{d}x_{t-1}\nonumber \\
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1}) & =\int p(x_{t}|x_{t-1},y_{1:t-1})p(x_{t-1}|y_{1:t-1})\;\mathrm{d}x_{t-1}\nonumber \\
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1}) & =\int p(x_{t}|x_{t-1})p(x_{t-1}|y_{1:t-1})\;\mathrm{d}x_{t-1}.\label{eq:PriorPdf}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next straightforward step in the solution is to derive 
\emph on
posterior
\emph default
 probability density function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x_{t}|y_{1:t})$
\end_inset

, which is done by applying the Bayes' theorem and taking the fact that
 observation 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 depends only on the newest state 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(y_{t}|x_{t},y_{1:t-1})=p(y_{t}|x_{t})$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t}) & =\frac{p(y_{t}|x_{t},y_{1:t-1})p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1})}{p(y_{t}|y_{1:t-1})}\nonumber \\
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t}) & =\frac{p(y_{t}|x_{t})p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1})}{p(y_{t}|y_{1:t-1})},\label{eq:PosteriorPdf}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where the denominator of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:PosteriorPdf"

\end_inset

 can be computed using marginalization over 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 or not at all, because it doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 and serves only the purpose of a normalization constant.

 together form the solution of the problem posed above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, this solution in its general form has only limited applicatio
n, because the integral 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:PriorPdf"

\end_inset

, unless tractable analytically, constitutes a major computational challenge.
 The situation when the analytical solution is known is represented mainly
 by the famous Kalman filter
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kalman:60"

\end_inset

 and its variants, which applies when state and observation models are linear
 and noises are normally distributed.
 If these models are highly non-linear (which is our case in radioactive
 release assimilation), one of the viable approaches is to resort to some
 kind of approximation of the solution.
 One such approximation is a particle filter described below.

\begin_layout Section

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the total number of particles (an important parameter of the filter),
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{t}^{(i)}$

\begin_layout Standard
The popularity of the particle filter may come from the fact that it is
 distinctively general and easy to apply to a wide range of Bayesian problems,
 regardless of analytical tractability of integrals that occur in generic
 solution: the only performed operations with involved densities is sampling
 from the proposal density and evaluation of the proposal, state and observation
 densities.
 However, this convenience comes with a cost.
 First and foremost, the particle filter is an approximate and stochastic
 method.
 While convergence to the optimal Bayesian solution 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 approaches infinity is proven under a set of assumptions,

 real-world applications must find a trade-off between accuracy (which improves

 time linearly depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another peculiarity of the particle filter is a 
\emph on
sample impoverishment
\emph default
 phenomenon.
 It is described as a tendency of the weights of all-but-one particle to
 drop to zero as time progresses (unless counter-measured), i.e.
 the variance of the weights tends to raise without bounds.
 Untreated, this property effectively degenerates the posterior density
 to a single Dirac delta function, making the filter anything but useful.
 Common approach to eliminate this is the resampling described in step 3.

 The resampling step mitigates some effects of the sample impoverishment,

, available resources are used ineffectively, as accuracy of the estimate
 is only improved by the

 overhead.
 This problem is most pronounced when the proposal density doesn't match
 the resulting posterior density sufficiently (often being too broad) a
 condition often observed in the bootstrap filter.
 In accordance with literature, our tests have shown that careful choice
 of the proposal density can render sample impoverishment much more subtle
 problem.

 It is a modification of the particle filter where filtering is done directly

\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i\text{=1}}^{N}\omega_{t-1}^{(i)}p(x_{t}|x_{t-1}^{(i)})$
\end_inset

 The authors suggest proposal probability density function in a similar
 form 
\begin_inset Formula $q(x_{t}|y_{1:t})=\sum_{i\text{=1}}^{N}\omega_{t-1}^{(i)}q(x_{t}|y_{t},x_{t-1}^{(i)})$

The authors argue that sampling from a more complete proposal density (that
 takes other weighted particles into account) effectively fights the sample
 impoverishment problem and relieves the need to perform the resampling

 and variance of the weights.
 Additionally it is shown (in the case of Auxiliary Marginal Particle Filter,
 an analogous extension of the auxiliary variable particle filter) that
 variance of the weights can be only less or equal than in non-marginal
 variant.
 It should be noted that when

 of effective particles) at the cost of increased complexity of the algorithm
 must, in our opinion, prove that it brings an improvement even when this

 We suggest using

 In case of radioactive release the total puff activity decreases over time
 by radioactive decay.
 The frequency of puff release must be carefully chosen, it must be high
 enough so that the effects of a series of puffs approximate effects of
 a contiguous plume well enough, but the higher the value the greater computatio
nal power is needed and, more importantly, release frequency greater than
 the one of important measuring devices would introduce harmful ambiguity
 and should be, in our belief, avoided.
 In our case, a radioactive monitoring network around the facility, the
 most critical source of the pollutant release rate information, measures
 time-integrated dose in 10-minute intervals, we therefore set release interval
 to 10 minutes in our experiments.

\begin_layout Standard
While many previous works assume temporally correlated release rate, where
 released pollutant quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{t}$
\end_inset

 depends on quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 released in the previous step, we consider them to be uncorrelated, allowing
 us to assume
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(Q_{t}|Q_{t-1})=p(Q_{t})=\mathcal{G}\left(\alpha_{Q},\beta_{Q}\right),
\]

\end_inset

where the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{Q}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{Q}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset
