\begin_layout Standard
We are concerned with assimilation of radioactive pollutants as they disperse
 in the atmosphere; that is to give the best estimate of the pollutant distribut
ion in the environment and its progress in time, given a set of measurements
 with varying degree of accuracy.
 The problem is approached using the mathematical framework of recursive
 Bayesian estimation, which is briefly presented in the first section.
 This general problem statement and solution is then followed by description
 of a so-called Particle Filter,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
also known as the Sequential Importance resampling (SIR) or Sequential Monte
 Carlo method
\end_layout

\end_inset

 a variant of which is employed to perform the assimilation.
 We also briefly discuss the Marginal Particle Filter, a derivate which
 is designed to counter some inherent problems of Bayesian particle filtering.

\begin_layout Standard
Recursive Bayesian estimation
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 yields an estimate (in form of probability density functions) of a sequence
 of hidden state vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1:t}$
\end_inset

 at discrete time steps 
\begin_inset Formula $1:t$
\end_inset

 given sequence of available measurements (observations) 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1:t}$
\end_inset

, known (or assumed) noisy state model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:DynSysFt"

\end_inset

 and known (or assumed) noisy observation model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:DynSysHt"

\end_inset

.
 State model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:DynSysFt"

\end_inset

 describes how state evolves in time; more precisely it prescribes that
 state 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

, depends on previous state 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 and random state noise 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 (whose statistical properties need to be known) through the means of function
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{t}$
\end_inset

, which often does not vary with time and is therefore labeled just 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, measurement model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:DynSysHt"

\end_inset

 prescribes that visible measurements 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

, depend via function 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{t}$
\end_inset

 (often just time-independent 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

) on hidden state 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 and random observation noise 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{t}$
\end_inset

, probability density function of which is likewise known.
 Summarizing this, we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
x_{t} & =f_{t}(x_{t-1},v_{t-1})\label{eq:DynSysFt}\\
y_{t} & =h_{t}(x_{t},w_{t}).\label{eq:DynSysHt}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Bayesian solution can now be derived.
 Both 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}\;(\forall t)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{r}\;(\forall t)$
\end_inset

 are treated as (multivariate) random variables from now on.
 First, let us observe that the 
\emph on
state probability density function
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x_{t}|x_{t-1})$
\end_inset

 can be derived from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:DynSysFt"

\end_inset

 and the 
\emph on
observation probability density function
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $p(y_{t}|x_{t})$
\end_inset

 can be derived from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:DynSysHt"

\end_inset

 likewise.
 So-called 
\emph on
prior
\emph default
 probability density function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1})$
\end_inset

 can be expressed using only known densities by applying reverse marginalization
 over 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t-1}$
\end_inset

, applying chain rule for probability density functions and finally taking
 into account that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 when already conditioned on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t-1}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 we assume Markov property) 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1}) & =\int p(x_{t},x_{t-1}|y_{1:t-1})\;\mathrm{d}x_{t-1}\nonumber \\
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1}) & =\int p(x_{t}|x_{t-1},y_{1:t-1})p(x_{t-1}|y_{1:t-1})\;\mathrm{d}x_{t-1}\nonumber \\
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1}) & =\int p(x_{t}|x_{t-1})p(x_{t-1}|y_{1:t-1})\;\mathrm{d}x_{t-1}.\label{eq:PriorPdf}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next straightforward step in the solution is to derive 
\emph on
posterior
\emph default
 probability density function 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x_{t}|y_{1:t})$
\end_inset

, which is done by applying the Bayes' theorem and taking the fact that
 observation 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 depends only on the newest state 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(y_{t}|x_{t},y_{1:t-1})=p(y_{t}|x_{t})$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t}) & =\frac{p(y_{t}|x_{t},y_{1:t-1})p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1})}{p(y_{t}|y_{1:t-1})}\nonumber \\
p(x_{t}|y_{1:t}) & =\frac{p(y_{t}|x_{t})p(x_{t}|y_{1:t-1})}{p(y_{t}|y_{1:t-1})},\label{eq:PosteriorPdf}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where the denominator of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:PosteriorPdf"

\end_inset

 can be computed using marginalization over 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 or not at all, because it doesn't depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{t}$
\end_inset

 and serves only the purpose of a normalization constant.

 together form the solution of the problem posed above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, this solution in its general form has only limited applicatio
n, because the integral 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:PriorPdf"

\end_inset

, unless tractable analytically, constitutes a major computational challenge.
 The situation when the analytical solution is known is represented mainly
 by the famous Kalman filter
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kalman:60"

\end_inset

 and its variants, which applies when state and observation models are linear
 and noises are normally distributed.
 If these models are highly non-linear (which is our case in radioactive
 release assimilation), one of the viable approaches is to resort to some
 kind of approximation of the solution.
 One such approximation is a particle filter described below.

\begin_layout Section

where

\begin_layout Standard
The popularity of the particle filter may come from the fact that it is
 distinctively general and easy to apply to a wide range of Bayesian problems,
 regardless of analytical tractability of integrals that occur in generic
 solution: the only performed operations with involved densities is sampling
 from the proposal density and evaluation of the proposal, state and observation
 densities.
 However, this convenience comes with a cost.
 First and foremost, the particle filter is an approximate and stochastic
 method.
 While convergence to the optimal Bayesian solution 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $N$

 approaches infinity is proven under a set of assumptions,

 real-world applications must find a trade-off between accuracy (which improves

 time linearly depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another peculiarity of the particle filter is a 
\emph on
sample impoverishment
\emph default
 phenomenon.
 It is described as a tendency of the weights of all-but-one particle to
 drop to zero as time progresses (unless counter-measured), i.e.
 the variance of the weights tends to raise without bounds.
 Untreated, this property effectively degenerates the posterior density
 to a single Dirac delta function, making the filter anything but useful.
 Common approach to eliminate this is the resampling described in step 3.

 The resampling step mitigates some effects of the sample impoverishment,

, available resources are used ineffectively, as accuracy of the estimate
 is only improved by the

 overhead.
 This problem is most pronounced when the proposal density doesn't match
 the resulting posterior density sufficiently (often being too broad) a
 condition often observed in the bootstrap filter.
 In accordance with literature, our tests have shown that careful choice
 of the proposal density can render sample impoverishment much more subtle
 problem.

 It is a modification of the particle filter where filtering is done directly

\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i\text{=1}}^{N}\omega_{t-1}^{(i)}p(x_{t}|x_{t-1}^{(i)})$

 The authors suggest proposal probability density function in a similar
 form

 Additionally it is shown (in the case of Auxiliary Marginal Particle Filter,

 variance of the weights can be only less or equal than in non-marginal

 We suggest using

 In case of radioactive release the total puff activity decreases over time
 by radioactive decay.
 The frequency of puff release must be carefully chosen, it must be high
 enough so that the effects of a series of puffs approximate effects of
 a contiguous plume well enough, but the higher the value the greater computatio
nal power is needed and, more importantly, release frequency greater than
 the one of important measuring devices would introduce harmful ambiguity
 and should be, in our belief, avoided.
 In our case, a radioactive monitoring network around the facility, the
 most critical source of the pollutant release rate information, measures
 time-integrated dose in 10-minute intervals, we therefore set release interval
 to 10 minutes in our experiments.

 All mentioned quantities are time-dependent.
 Both

The favorable properties lie in availability of so-called conjugate priors
 (shown later in this text) in analytical forms for these probability density

 We argue that truncated normal distribution is a good approximation for

 released in the previous step, we consider them to be uncorrelated.
 Among suitable probability density functions with non-negative support,
 Gamma distribution was used so that
\begin_inset Formula

 serves the purpose of making this an uninformative prior, the one that
 assumes as little as possible about the system apart from objective constrains
 such as non-negativeness or continuousness.
 In our case this can be done without impacting the feasibility of the assimilat
ion because the measurements supply enough information.

To conclude construction of the state variable, we need to add the rest

 total flown distance 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{k,t}$

\end_inset

 Under this formalism, the state space is extremely high-dimensional (for
 the purpose of Monte Carlo sampling) and its dimension grows without bounds
 in time as new puffs are released.
 Neither of these properties pose a real problem in practice, because
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
puffs can be discarded when certain criteria are met and their contribution
 to the environment is negligible, usually residual activity when radioactive
 decay is taken into account, distance from the area of interest and total
 dispersion can be considered; with this mechanism, no puffs are simulated
 under normal conditions where no pollutant release occurs in continuous
 monitoring scenario,

 In particular, assuming puff number

 As however mentioned earlier, our task of environmental assimilation is
 a very demanding one for Monte Carlo estimation, mainly because our observation
 density is extremely narrow compared to transition density, which must
 be wide enough to account for rapid changes of weather or release rate.
 If we used the bootstrap variant of the particle filter directly, we would
 end up with overwhelming majority of particles being sampled into areas
 where whey would be assigned negligible likelihoods by the observation
 model.
 In other words, we would face severe case of the sample impoverishment
 problem.

this is possible because

 of the just released puff 
\begin_inset Formula $Q{}_{t}$

 (marked simply as

 in this subsection for simplicity) from expected doses 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{t,i}$

 and fix other parameters (such as activities of other puffs and wind field)
 so that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}

 Since this density has no standard known form, the normalization factor
 cannot be inferred analytically, as it was done above.
 We can approximate it using normal distribution
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p(Q|y_{t,1:M})\approx\mathcal{N}(\mu_{Q},\sigma_{Q}^{2}),\label{eq:p_Q_y_proposal_approx}
\end{equation}

 Its mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{Q}$
\end_inset

 is aligned with local maxima, denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Q}$
\end_inset

, of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:p_y_Q_explicit"

\end_inset

, which is obtained by computing derivative of its logarithm
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\frac{d\log(p(Q|y_{t,1:M}))}{dQ} & =\frac{d}{dQ}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left[\alpha_{i}\log(\beta_{i}Q+m_{i})-\frac{\beta_{i}Q+m_{i}}{y_{t,i}}\right]+(\alpha_{Q}-1)\log Q-\beta_{Q}Q\right)\nonumber \\
 & =\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left[\frac{\alpha_{i}\beta_{i}}{\beta_{i}Q+m_{i}}-\frac{\beta_{i}}{y_{t,i}}\right]+\frac{\alpha_{Q}-1}{Q}-\beta_{Q},\label{eq:ig-d-log}
\end{align}

\end_inset

which yields a sum of decreasing rational functions, allowing us to find
 the only possible zero crossing using efficient numerical methods.
 Second derivative of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:ig-d-log"

\end_inset

 is then computed and made equal to inverse covariance matrix of the approximate
d normal distribution 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 at point of its maxima,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{Q}^{-2}=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left[\frac{\alpha_{i}\beta_{i}^{2}}{(\beta_{i}\hat{Q}+m_{i})^{2}}\right]+\frac{\alpha_{Q}-1}{\hat{Q}^{2}}.
