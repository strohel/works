Dependencies
============

Modules in this directory need the "asim" UTIA package to be installed in Python's path.
This is most easily done by running `python setup.py install` in asim's repository root
directory.

Manual execution
================

You can execute this worker manually by calling `python task.py` - in which case it will
try to open example_input.json and output example_output.json.
