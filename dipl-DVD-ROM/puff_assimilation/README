Dependencies
============

Modules in this directory need the "asim" UTIA package to be installed in Python's path.
This is most easily done by running `python setup.py install` in asim's repository root
directory.

Manual execution
================

You can execute this worker manually by calling `python task.py` - in which case it will
try to open example_input.json and output example_output.json. As input to this worker
you can use output of the puff_simulation worker.

Notice:
 * you may want to add noise to puff_simulation before passing it to puff_assimilation
   for more realistic scenario.
 * puff_assimilation expects that the 'off_grid_doses' input array does *NOT* contain
   natural radioactive background.
