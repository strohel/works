PyBayes is an effort to create general, convenient to use and fast library for Bayesian filtering
(and perhaps decision making in future). It is written in Python, but can make use of Cython to
accelerate performance-critical code-paths.

You may want to see `my bachelor thesis`_ for introduction to recursice Bayesian estimation,
underlying software analysis and background information for PyBayes.
